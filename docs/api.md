# API

The server exposes a REST API under `/api`, a versioned namespace under `/api/v1`, a WebSocket endpoint at
`/ws`, and read-only endpoints for AI assistants under `/api/ai`. The full request and response schemas are
in the OpenAPI document:

- UI: `GET /api/docs`
- JSON: `GET /api/docs/openapi.json`

Unknown `/api/*` paths return a JSON error instead of the web client.

## Route groups

### PoSe ban analysis

`GET /api/v1/masternodes/ban-waves` accepts `scope=rolling` (default) or `scope=q60`.
The Ban Detection page defaults to Q60 history. Q60 selects confirmed bans whose
`poseBanHeight` is at least mainnet activation height **144888**; a later discovery
height does not move an older ban into this period. The activation timestamp is
read from the daemon's block header. If that lookup fails, the endpoint returns an
error or explicitly marked stale cached history. Events without a known ban height
are excluded from Q60 analysis and counted in `analysisScope.unclassifiedEvents`.

The requested `hours` window still applies (maximum 2160 hours / 90 days of retained
history). `analysisScope` describes the effective start and whether it truncates
the activation period. Current registered/active/banned/penalty counts always refer
to the full live daemon snapshot, independently of the historical scope.
When `rpcAvailable=false` or `dataStatus=stale`, these counts must be shown as unknown.

`trackedNodes` includes isolated bans as well as wave members, grouped by stable
masternode identity and ordered by distinct ban count, then latest event. Duplicate
observations of the same node and ban block count once. Current state and penalty
are nullable for unavailable or unregistered nodes. The confirmed-ban timeline
covers the selected period; the explicitly named `freshDrops24h` and
`freshDropEvents24h` fields remain 24-hour measures within the selected scope.
Auto timeline buckets use the effective duration for Q60 views.

Wave grouping remains tunable with `windowMinutes` (5–120), `minNodes` (2–50), and
`bucket`. Geographic/operator concentration is correlation, not proof of a cause.

| Group | |

| `/api/blocks`, `/api/block` | Blocks |
| `/api/txs`, `/api/tx` | Transactions |
| `/api/address` | Addresses |
| `/api/richlist`, `/api/stats`, `/api/search` | Rich list, statistics, search |
| `/api/sync` | Indexer sync state |
| `/api/network` | Network, chain health, seed nodes and node feeds |
| `/api/mempool`, `/api/market`, `/api/coin` | Mempool, market data, coin constants |
| `/api/masternodes` | Masternodes |
| `/api/migration` | Migration transparency |
| `/api/ai` | Read-only endpoints for AI assistants (see below) |
| `/api/admin` | Admin endpoints, protected by `ADMIN_API_KEY` |

Versioned namespace:

- `/api/v1/meta`
- `/api/v1/network/*`
- `/api/v1/rewards/*`
- `/api/v1/blocks/*`, `/api/v1/txs/*`, `/api/v1/address/*`
- `/api/v1/masternodes/*`
- `/api/v1/provider-tags/*`
- `/api/v1/node-inventory` and `/api/v1/node-inventory/versions`
- `/api/v1/network-noise/summary` (public) and `/api/v1/network-noise/ingest` (per-node bearer token)
- `/api/v1/migration/*`

## Realtime WebSocket

- local: `ws://127.0.0.1:3001/ws`
- behind a TLS proxy: `wss://<your-domain>/ws`

Server events: `hello`, `sync:status`, `block:new`, `tx:new`, `pong`, `error`. Client event: `ping`.

When `CORS_ORIGINS` is set, it also decides which `Origin` values may open `/ws`.

## Provider tags

Provider attribution works by CIDR/IP rules.

Public endpoints:

- `GET /api/v1/provider-tags/active`
- `POST /api/v1/provider-tags/submit`
- `POST /api/v1/provider-tags/submit-bulk`

The bulk flow takes one entry per line (`IP`, `IP:port` or CIDR), normalizes entries to CIDR (`IP` becomes
`/32`), removes duplicates, reports invalid lines and queues everything for review (`pending`) instead of
activating it.

Admin endpoints (`x-api-key: <ADMIN_API_KEY>` or `Authorization: Bearer <ADMIN_API_KEY>`):

- `GET /api/admin/provider-tags`, `POST /api/admin/provider-tags`
- `PATCH /api/admin/provider-tags/:id/active`
- `GET /api/admin/provider-tags/submissions`
- `POST /api/admin/provider-tags/submissions/:id/approve`
- `POST /api/admin/provider-tags/submissions/:id/reject`

When the Telegram bot is enabled, single submissions (`POST /api/v1/provider-tags/submit`) are also sent to
the admin with approve and reject buttons. Bulk submissions are reviewed through the admin API only.

## Nodes and node inventory

- `GET /api/network/seed-nodes`: the three hardcoded seed nodes from DeFCoN Core `chainparamsseeds.h`. Each
  seed publishes `http://<seed>/api/seed-status.json`; the server polls it every 60 seconds and reports
  divergence only when two seeds show different hashes at the same height or their tips are more than 3
  blocks apart.
- `GET /api/network/pre-release-nodes`: the Test Nodes panel. Optional external feed at
  `PRE_RELEASE_NODES_API_URL`; `PRE_RELEASE_NODES_API_KEY` is sent as `X-API-Key` from the server only and
  never reaches the browser.
- `GET /api/network/dns-seeder-nodes`: the DNS-Seeder panel. Optional external feed at `DNS_SEEDER_API_URL`.
- `GET /api/network/chain-health`, `GET /api/network/ops-status`
- `GET /api/v1/node-inventory`, `GET /api/v1/node-inventory/versions`

Both external feeds return JSON: an array of node records, or an object with a `data` or `nodes` array. The
feed routes normalize the fields, enrich DNS-seeder rows with local peer metadata and live peer heights from
RPC when available, serve the last good snapshot on upstream failure while it is younger than
`NODE_INVENTORY_STALE_MAX_AGE_MS`, and return an empty list, without an upstream request, when the feed URL is
unset.

`nodeInventory.service` collects all sources every `NODE_INVENTORY_POLL_INTERVAL_MS` and stores the result in
MongoDB. The node-inventory endpoints mark nodes below `NODE_INVENTORY_MIN_VERSION` (default `23.0.0`) as
deprecated.

The public Network page uses `GET /api/v1/node-inventory/active-versions`:

- Membership comes from the current daemon snapshot (`ENABLED` + `POSE_PENALTY`),
  deduplicated by masternode identity. Banned, inactive and removed entries cannot
  re-enter through old inventory records. Active status is not proof of reachability;
  a missing crawler observation alone does not mark a masternode offline.
- Versions are joined by the current IP and port. Every known version is counted
  in its version bucket, including older observations. Missing versions are unknown;
  all active nodes stay in the denominator. Freshness is independent: only
  `lastVersionObservedAt` within the last 24 hours qualifies as fresh. Old, undated
  or future-dated observations are stale, but still count toward their last-known
  version. `recommended` and `deprecated` count all identified versions;
  `coveragePct` continues to describe fresh observation coverage.
- The response exposes `statusObservedAt`, the configured `inventoryPollSeconds`
  and `versionMaxAgeSeconds`. The browser polls every 30 seconds while visible;
  inventory collection defaults to 300 seconds. External source delays are additional.
- HTTP caching is disabled for this endpoint; daemon snapshot reuse follows
  `CACHE_TTL_SECONDS`. RPC/inventory errors return 503 rather than historical percentages.
  An empty RPC result also returns 503 because the legacy RPC adapter cannot
  distinguish an empty network from all fallback calls failing.
- The older `/versions` endpoint retains its historical IP-sample semantics.

## Network noise

Agents running next to monitored nodes push observations to `POST /api/v1/network-noise/ingest` with a
per-node bearer token; `GET /api/v1/network-noise/summary` feeds the Network Noise Monitor page. Ingest is
disabled unless `NETWORK_NOISE_MONITOR_ENABLED=true`. The contract and scoring are in
[`network-noise-monitor.md`](network-noise-monitor.md).

## AI endpoints and MCP

Read-only endpoints for AI assistants and bots (GET only, `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`):

- `GET /api/ai/lookup?q=`: an address, a 64-character transaction or block hash, or a block height
- `GET /api/ai/network`: chain tip and masternode counts
- `GET /api/ai/masternode?q=`: a masternode by IP, `IP:port` or proTxHash

Amounts in `/api/ai/*` responses are integer strings in satoshis (1 DFCN = 100,000,000 satoshis).

Discovery files are served from `client/public`: `/llms.txt`, `/llms-full.txt`, `/.well-known/llms.txt` and
`/.well-known/deftrack-ai.json`.

The `mcp/` workspace is a stdio MCP server with the tools `lookup`, `network`, `masternode` and `pose_bans`.
It sends only `GET` requests to the public API and limits itself to 20 requests per minute. Build, run and
client configuration are in [`mcp/README.md`](../mcp/README.md).
