# Operations

This document describes the supported workflows for running the explorer in production: preflight, deployment, MongoDB backup and restore. It also covers the reference host layout, baseline hardening and troubleshooting.

To report a vulnerability, see [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md).

## Reference Deployment

The operations scripts target a single Linux host:

- Cloudflare proxies public traffic to nginx on ports 80 and 443.
- nginx is a pure reverse proxy. It forwards everything to the Node app on `127.0.0.1:3001`, and Express serves the API, the `/ws` WebSocket endpoint and the built client.
- systemd runs the app (`server/dist/index.js`, `NODE_ENV=production`) as `deftrack.service`. systemd lets values from `EnvironmentFile` override `Environment=`, so the production `.env` must not set `NODE_ENV`, or must set it to `production`.
- MongoDB and the DeFCoN Core daemon (`defcond`) run on the same host. MongoDB and the daemon's RPC interface listen on `127.0.0.1` only; the daemon's P2P port (`8192`) may accept inbound connections (see [Production Hardening](#production-hardening)). The app reads the chain over the daemon's JSON-RPC interface.
- Readiness endpoint: `http://127.0.0.1:3001/api/health/ready`. It returns `{"status":"ok"}` only when both MongoDB and the daemon RPC are reachable, and `degraded` or `down` otherwise.

The scripts require bash, systemd, GNU coreutils and findutils, `git`, `node`/`npm`, `curl`, and the MongoDB Database Tools (`mongodump`, `mongorestore`).

### Reference configuration files

`docs/server-config/` contains sanitized reference examples, not copies of a live host. Adjust the domain, paths and accounts before you use them.

| File | Installs as | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `deftrack.service` | `/etc/systemd/system/deftrack.service` | App unit with a dedicated service account and systemd sandboxing |
| `defcond.service` | `/etc/systemd/system/defcond.service` | DeFCoN Core daemon unit, plus the `defcon.conf` settings the explorer needs |
| `nginx-deftrack.conf` | `/etc/nginx/sites-available/deftrack` | TLS termination, HTTP-to-HTTPS redirect, catch-all for unknown hosts, `/ws` upgrade, client-IP forwarding |
| `cloudflare-allowlist.conf` | `/etc/nginx/snippets/cloudflare-allowlist.conf` | Accept connections from Cloudflare edge ranges only |

### Script defaults and overrides

Run the scripts from the checkout, as the account that owns it. `systemctl` and `journalctl` run through `sudo` unless the script already runs as root. Each setting can be overridden with an environment variable, and most also have a command-line flag:

| Variable | Flag | Default | Used by |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `APP_DIR` | `--app-dir` | the checkout that contains the scripts | all scripts |
| `SERVICE_NAME` | `--service` | `deftrack.service` | preflight, deploy, restore |
| `HEALTH_URL` | `--health-url` | `http://127.0.0.1:3001/api/health/ready` | preflight, deploy, restore |
| `ENV_FILE` | none | `$APP_DIR/.env` | preflight, backup, restore |
| `MONGODB_URI` | none | read from `ENV_FILE` | preflight, backup, restore |
| `DEPLOY_BRANCH` | `--branch` | `main` | deploy |
| `BACKUP_DIR` | `--backup-dir` | `$APP_DIR/backups/mongodb` | backup, restore |
| `BACKUP_KEEP_DAYS` | `--keep-days` | `14` | backup |
| `APP_OWNER` | none | owner of `APP_DIR` | deploy, when run as root |

Notes:

- `--app-dir` also resets the environment file to `<dir>/.env` and, for backup and restore, the backup root to `<dir>/backups/mongodb`. Pass `--backup-dir` after `--app-dir`. `ops:deploy` always passes `--app-dir` to preflight, so a deploy checks `$APP_DIR/.env`.
- `APP_OWNER` matters only when a script runs as root. The deploy then runs `git`, `npm ci`, lint, tests and the build as that account through `sudo -u`. When `APP_OWNER` is unset, the scripts use the owner of the checkout directory.
- The restore passes its `APP_DIR` and `ENV_FILE` on to the safety backup.

Example, to operate a checkout other than the one you run the scripts from:

```bash
APP_DIR=/opt/deftrack npm run ops:preflight -- --require-clean
```

## Inventory Validation

Every `.sh`, `.py`, `.mjs` or `.ts` file under `scripts/` (and under `server/src/scripts/`, if that directory exists) must have an entry in `scripts/operations.manifest.json`. Each entry records the path, status, owner, purpose, invocation and safety behaviour.

```bash
npm run ops:validate
```

The validator fails on unclassified scripts, on entries that point to missing files, and on missing fields. CI runs it on pushes to `main` and on pull requests. The allowed states are:

- `supported`: maintained and documented entry point
- `compatibility`: thin forwarding wrapper to a supported entry point. `scripts/deploy.sh`, `scripts/backup.sh` and `scripts/restore.sh` forward to `scripts/ops/`.

## Preflight

Run a read-only validation before maintenance:

```bash
npm run ops:preflight -- --require-clean
```

Preflight fails if any of these checks fails:

- The checkout is a Git repository with a root `package.json`.
- The environment file exists.
- The worktree is clean. This check applies only with `--require-clean`.
- `MONGODB_URI` can be resolved.
- `RPC_HOST`, `RPC_PORT`, `RPC_USER` and `RPC_PASS` are all present in the environment file. Preflight requires all four keys, although the server itself has defaults for the first three.
- The readiness endpoint returns `status=ok`. Use `--skip-health` to skip this check.

Preflight also reports the branch, commit, Node and npm versions, the systemd state, and whether the optional node feeds (`DNS_SEEDER_API_URL`, `PRE_RELEASE_NODES_API_URL`) are set in the environment file. It warns if the environment file is group-writable or accessible to other users (`600` or `640` is recommended). Secret values are never printed.

Useful options:

```bash
npm run ops:preflight -- --skip-health
npm run ops:preflight -- --app-dir /opt/deftrack --service deftrack.service
```

## Deployment

Preview the deploy without changing the repository, dependencies, build output or service state:

```bash
npm run ops:deploy -- --dry-run
```

Run the supported deployment:

```bash
npm run ops:deploy
```

The workflow runs these steps in order:

1. Runs preflight with `--require-clean`, which includes the readiness check.
2. Requires the checkout to be on the deploy branch (`main` by default).
3. Fetches `origin/<branch>` and applies it with `git merge --ff-only`.
4. Installs the lockfile with `npm ci`.
5. Runs lint and the CI tests.
6. Builds the shared, server and client workspaces.
7. Restarts the service and polls readiness for about a minute (30 attempts, 2 seconds apart).

If readiness does not recover, the deploy prints the service status and the last 50 journal lines, then exits with an error.

Because preflight includes the readiness check, a deploy refuses to start while the running service is unhealthy. Restore the service first (see [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)).

`--skip-tests` skips lint and the CI tests. Use it only in an approved emergency. It never skips the build or the readiness check after the restart.

## MongoDB Backup

Validate the backup configuration:

```bash
npm run ops:backup -- --dry-run
```

Create a compressed backup:

```bash
npm run ops:backup
```

Backups are written to `$APP_DIR/backups/mongodb/defcon_explorer_<UTC timestamp>`, for example `defcon_explorer_20260923T101500Z`. The `backups/` directory is git-ignored, so backups inside the checkout do not make the worktree dirty.

A dump counts as restorable only when it contains gzipped BSON data and a `.complete` marker. It also contains a `backup.meta` file with the creation time, Git commit and collection count. Incomplete dumps are removed automatically. After a successful dump, the script deletes completed backups in the backup root that are older than the retention period, which defaults to 14 days. `--no-prune` skips this retention pass.

MongoDB credentials reach `mongodump` and `mongorestore` only through a temporary config file with mode `0600`. They are never printed or placed in command arguments.

## MongoDB Restore

Always validate the selected backup first:

```bash
npm run ops:restore -- --backup defcon_explorer_TIMESTAMP --dry-run
```

A real restore requires explicit confirmation:

```bash
npm run ops:restore -- --backup defcon_explorer_TIMESTAMP --yes
```

The restore accepts only completed backups inside the configured backup root. It runs these steps:

1. Creates a fresh safety backup.
2. Stops the service.
3. Restores MongoDB with `mongorestore --drop`.
4. Starts the service and verifies readiness.

If the restore fails after the service was stopped, an exit trap tries to start the service again.

The safety backup runs with `--no-prune`, so a restore never deletes existing backups.

## Production Hardening

Baseline guidance for an explorer host. The reference files in `docs/server-config/` already follow it where it applies.

**Accounts and SSH**

- Allow key-only SSH: set `PermitRootLogin no` and `PasswordAuthentication no`. Cloud images often ship drop-ins in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/` (for example `50-cloud-init.conf`) that turn password logins back on. Check the effective settings with `sudo sshd -T | grep -Ei 'permitrootlogin|passwordauthentication'`.
- Log in with a non-root admin account. That account owns the checkout and runs the `npm run ops:*` scripts. Run the app under a separate unprivileged service account (`deftrack` in the reference unit) with no sudo rights and no login shell. The service account only needs read access to the checkout. Run the daemon under its own account (`defcon`).
- Enable fail2ban for `sshd`, and unattended upgrades for security updates.

**Network**

- Set the firewall to deny incoming traffic by default. Allow only `22/tcp` (SSH), `80/tcp` and `443/tcp` (nginx), and optionally the DeFCoN P2P port `8192/tcp`. The daemon syncs over outbound connections, so inbound P2P is optional. You can also restrict SSH to known source addresses.
- Keep the app (`3001`), MongoDB (`27017`) and the daemon RPC (`8193`) on `127.0.0.1`. The app always binds to `127.0.0.1`. For MongoDB, set `net.bindIp: 127.0.0.1`. For the daemon, set `rpcbind=127.0.0.1` and `rpcallowip=127.0.0.1`.
- Let nginx accept only Cloudflare ranges by including `cloudflare-allowlist.conf` in every server block that proxies to the app. The catch-all block closes connections for unknown hosts. To verify from a machine outside Cloudflare, run `curl -skI --resolve <your-domain>:443:<origin-ip> https://<your-domain>/`. It should return `403`.
- nginx must overwrite `X-Forwarded-For` and `X-Real-IP` with `CF-Connecting-IP`, not append to them, as the reference config does. Set `TRUST_PROXY` to the exact number of proxy hops and never to `true`. Otherwise clients can spoof their IP and bypass the per-IP rate limits.

**Service**

- Sandbox the app with systemd: `NoNewPrivileges=true`, `PrivateTmp=true`, `ProtectSystem=full` and `ProtectHome=read-only`.
- The app sets `Content-Security-Policy`, `Strict-Transport-Security` (in production) and `Permissions-Policy` itself. The proxy must not hide, override or duplicate these headers.
- Set `CORS_ORIGINS` explicitly, and include the site's own public origin (for example `https://example.com`). The same list decides which `Origin` values may open the `/ws` WebSocket, so realtime updates fail with `403` if the site's origin is missing. If you enable the admin API, set `ADMIN_API_KEY` to at least 32 characters. Leave it empty to disable the admin API.

**Secrets**

- Keep `.env` at mode `600`, owned by the checkout owner. systemd reads `EnvironmentFile` before it drops privileges, so the service account needs no read access of its own. Never commit `.env`: `.gitignore` excludes `.env` and `.env.*` except `.env.example`.
- If a credential leaks, rotate it: the RPC password, MongoDB users, API keys, bot tokens or SSH keys. Replace it at the source, update `.env` and restart the service. Removing the value from a file or from Git history is not enough.

## Cloudflare

- Proxy the site's DNS records through Cloudflare, and use SSL/TLS mode **Full (strict)**. The reference nginx config serves a certificate on 443 and redirects port 80 to HTTPS, so **Flexible** mode would cause a redirect loop.
- **Browser Cache TTL must be "Respect Existing Headers".** Cacheable API responses send a `private` browser `max-age` of at most 15 minutes, plus `CDN-Cache-Control` and `Cloudflare-CDN-Cache-Control` for the edge (`server/src/middleware/cachePolicy.ts`). A Browser Cache TTL override replaces that `max-age` on every cacheable response. Only `no-store` and `no-cache` responses keep their headers. Browsers then serve stale API data for the length of the override, and the block height in the header stops updating. After you fix the setting, a hard reload clears responses that browsers already cached.
- Keep `cloudflare-allowlist.conf` in sync with <https://www.cloudflare.com/ips/>.

## Node Feeds

`DNS_SEEDER_API_URL` and `PRE_RELEASE_NODES_API_URL` have no default: they no longer fall back to a built-in value. An empty or unset value disables that feed. `/api/network/dns-seeder-nodes` and `/api/network/pre-release-nodes` then return an empty list, and the node inventory skips the source. **Before you deploy this version to an installation that uses these feeds, set both URLs explicitly in the production `.env`, or the feeds stop.** `PRE_RELEASE_NODES_API_KEY` is required in production only when `PRE_RELEASE_NODES_API_URL` is set.

## Benchmarks

```bash
npm run perf:api -- --baseUrl http://127.0.0.1:3001 --durationSec 30 --concurrency 25
npm run perf:ws -- --url ws://127.0.0.1:3001/ws --connections 8 --holdSec 20 --connectSpreadMs 4000
```

Only benchmark deployments you operate. The server's limits apply to benchmarks: the API limiter allows `RATE_LIMIT_MAX_PER_MINUTE` requests per minute per client IP (default 1200), and the WebSocket endpoint accepts at most 8 connections per IP. Requests over a limit are rejected with `429` and count as failures, so raise `RATE_LIMIT_MAX_PER_MINUTE` on the benchmark instance and keep `--connections` at 8 or less per source IP. Results are written to `artifacts/perf/`.

## Troubleshooting

After a reboot, the daemon can take several minutes to load its chainstate and reach its peers. Until the RPC answers, readiness reports `degraded` and the latest block may appear stuck. The first few minutes of this are normal. Investigate if the host has not recovered after about 10 minutes.

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:3001/api/health/ready   # {"status":"ok"}
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:3001/api/sync           # lastSyncedHeight == daemonHeight, blocksRemaining 0, rpcConnected true
systemctl status deftrack.service defcond.service
journalctl -u deftrack.service -n 100 --no-pager
sudo -u defcon defcon-cli -conf=/etc/defcon/defcon.conf -datadir=/var/lib/defcon getconnectioncount   # > 0
```

**The daemon reports a corrupted block database** (`Corrupted block database detected ... restart with -reindex`). This usually follows an unclean shutdown. Rebuild the indexes once with `-reindex`, which takes a long time:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop defcond.service
sudo -u defcon /usr/local/bin/defcond -daemon -reindex -conf=/etc/defcon/defcon.conf -datadir=/var/lib/defcon
# wait until the reindex has finished and the daemon has caught up with the network, then:
sudo -u defcon /usr/local/bin/defcon-cli -conf=/etc/defcon/defcon.conf -datadir=/var/lib/defcon stop
sudo systemctl start defcond.service
```

To prevent this, give the daemon unit a long `TimeoutStopSec`, as the reference unit does, so a shutdown or reboot does not kill the daemon mid-write.

**The site header shows an old block height or "Delayed", but `/api/sync` on the host is current.** Check the Cloudflare Browser Cache TTL (see [Cloudflare](#cloudflare)).

**The deploy refuses to start.** Preflight has failed, or the checkout is not on the deploy branch. The log line names the failing check: a dirty worktree, a missing environment key, the wrong branch or failed readiness.
